Hello,

This repository is an exploration of Game Artificial Intelligence.

Our code for Assignment two can be found in the following files:

src/pacman/entries/ghosts/MyGhosts
src/pacman/pathFinding/Dijkstra
src/pacman/pathFinding/Vertex

test/pacman/entries/ghosts/MyGhostsTest
src/pacman/pathFinding/DijkstraTest

Our MyGhosts can be run by uncommenting the 2 lines in Executor.java below the line that says:
//UNCOMMENT TO RUN A* ghosts
(uncomment lines 45 and 46)

Our Dijkstra can by run by uncommenting the line in Executor.java below the line that says:
//Uncomment to run dijkstra.
(uncomment line 42)

The dijkstra function will ask for a test input of the location of the maze file.
For example:

data/mazes/a
