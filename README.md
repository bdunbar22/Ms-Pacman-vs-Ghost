#Hello

This repository is an exploration of Game Artificial Intelligence.

Please see "Assignment 4/Game AI HW4" for an explanation of the most recent changes!

To run, you may simply run Executor main().
This will run a qMap with 0 for each q value visually.
Then it will train pac man on the qMap for 600 games.
Then it will test pac man for another 100 games and output the results to the console.
Finally, it will run a trained pac man visually.

If you wish to run again, you may reset the q values by going to data/qLearning/q_values and
replacing its contents with the untrained qMap in q_values2. Or you may change the qMapFile
string in Executor to "data/qLearning/q_values2".


Best,
Ben & Mengling
